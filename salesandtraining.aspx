                                It sounds a bit weird when you hear the words, "taking responsibility for success".
                                It's probably because we naturally associate responsibility with things that are
                                stressful, thankless and generally not fun.

                                but the final moments that lead up to the closing of a deal. Sales transactions
                                that showed promise of great returns have been known to turn into liabilities and
                                money losers when one party, intends on squeezing every penny out of a negotiation,
                                acted in a dishonest manner to negotiate unfair terms. "Sales Battles" are won and

                                Without balance - work suffers, home suffers and you suffer as a company. This program
                                deals with the 'whole person' and all of the issues that affect daily life - work,
                                home and everything in between. So everybody wins!
