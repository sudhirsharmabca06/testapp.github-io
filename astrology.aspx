                <p>
                    According to Indian Astrology, your true self & personality is defined by the position
                    of the planets, at the time & place of your birth. The present & future positions
                    of the planets are compared with those of your birth chart to predict your future.
                    This is the basis of Indian Astrology. The positions of the planets at the time
                    of your birth is determined first. This forms the birth data. Your birth data is
                    then compared to the positions of planets at various stages in life, to predict
                    your future and major events that could happen in your life.

                <strong>K.P. System</strong></p>
            <p>
                This is an excellent system (Paddhati) of astrological predictions conceived and
                created by The Great Indian Astrology master late Prof. K.S. Krishnamurti. KP System
                is based on finer points of Indian and Western astrology and borrows important concepts
                from many branches of astrology. Regarded as most accurate system of present time,
                KP System of astrology is easy to learn and easy to apply. Contrary to classical
                Hindu astrology, KP system is systematic and very well defined.</p>

                <strong>MANTRA HEALING</strong></p>
            <p>
                Every entity in the universe is composed of energy. Every syllable of a word let
                out in the ether is a carrier of energy and can be used to tap specific forms of
                energy in the atmosphere. Mantras are incantations hailing the Gods thereby stimulating
                the necessary energy flow. This is mentioned in the following shloka:</p>
            <p class="headingfont1">
                <strong>DAIVADHEENAM JAGATSARVAM MANTRADHEENAMTU DAIVATAM </strong>

            <br />
            <p>
                Meaning that, the whole universe is ruled by the Devas and the Devas are under the
                power of Mantras. The deities are also a part of this energy world, Shiva beings
                the supreme source of energy and Shakti its conscious form. Different energy forms
                called the Panchabhootas include the ether, air, water, fire and earth elements.
                The existence of these elements in the human body and as well as in the atmosphere
                facilitates the flow of energy between them.</p>
            <p class="headingfont1">
                <strong>Imbalances in the body-system </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Malfunctioning of the body system is caused by disproportionate energy levels in
                the system. Each organ has its own consciousness, and is capable of emanating and
                absorbing a certain amount of energy. Impropriety in this process (of radiation
                and absorption) can lead to abnormal activity of the organ or the organ system and
                can manifest as a disease.</p>
