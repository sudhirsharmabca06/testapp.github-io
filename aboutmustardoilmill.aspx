                <strong>The 6 Steps in Mustard Oil Production Process</strong>
            </p>

            <ul class="list3">
                <li>Seeds are dried: Mustard seeds are dried in the sun and they are transferred into silos for further storage, until the rest of the production process takes place. This step is very important as oil rapidly deteriorates in the process of water.
                </li>
                <li>Inspection and cleaning:　The next step in the process is transferring the seeds from the silo to the Chalna to be cleaned. During this process all the dirt and other foreign objects are removed from amongst the seeds. Water (or other fluids) are not used during this process.
                </li>
                <li>Seeds are heated：Heating the seeds before extraction begins, increases the oil yield. Heating also increases the protein availability, which is useful if the end result oil cake will be used for animal feed.
                </li>
                <li>The expelling process is started: After heating up the seeds are fed into the expeller and a batch type process follows. First the seeds are pressed and crushed for an hour to release a large amount of oil (approximately 23-26%); the residual oil cake is removed manually and is fed into the first expeller. The oil cake is then crushed even further in a high pressure chamber. Following this, the oil cake is fed into the second expeller and the process is repeated. In all there are 5 expellers, and the same process takes place in each expeller to ensure the maximum amount of oil is extracted. The total yield of oil is between 33% - 36% depending on the quality of the seeds that were used.
                </li>
                <li>Filtration process: After the final expelling process the oil is stored in an unfiltered oil tank from where the oil is fed to filter press for filtration. This process removes the last remaining impurities from the oil.
                </li>
                <li>Bottling: After the oil has been filtered, it can finally be bottled, sealed and labelled in order to be ready for sale.
                </li>
            </ul>
