                <strong>Are we Growing or Killing Intelligence?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Growing Intelligence is a choice people make knowingly or unknowingly. Often children
                are wrongly labeled, as not smart, not intelligent, useless, dumb, slower learner,
                hyperactive, lacks of focus, can’t concentrate, can’t remember, forgetful, and so
                on… While some of them are successful in getting the best out of it, but many are
                not, even as adults.

            <p class="headingfont1">
                <strong>INDIVIDUALIZE D LEARNING helps GROW THE RIGHT INTELLIGENCE</strong></p>
            <p>
                The fact is that we are all born different and our upbringing too is different.
                The way we think, feel, act, process & access information or learn is all different.
                So, “One Size Fits All’ approach to Learning & Intelligence does not work. You need
                to Individualize Learning to suit the specific Learning and Personality Style to
                Grow the Right Intelligence.
            </p>
            <p class="headingfont1">
                <strong>Learning Styles of children are not the same, each one of them learns a subject
                    or a topic within their zone of comfort. </strong>
            </p>
            
               
            <p>
                The learning to grow intelligence offers a treat to every individual to transform
                oneself into a being that he / she wants to be and gain big benefit of self confidence
                to make the impossible, possible You can even get help in measuring “where you are
                now” and “where you want to be” in achieving your goals. Draw up action plans to
                reinforce positive learning and eliminate negative behaviors.
