                    <strong>What is Reiki ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reiki is a form of alternative medicine developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist monk Mikao Usui.
                    Mikao Usui began training others as Reiki masters into this system which is completed as an attunement
                    process. When attending a Reiki course, the participant gets attuned by a Reiki master through a simple
                    process that opens him to receive and utilize more of the Universal Life Energy, or Rei-Ki.
                    The attunements have a very powerful balancing and healing effect on those that receive them.
                    The attunement is not a healing session, it creates the healer. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This form of Reiki is called Usui Reiki and is the most widely practiced form of Reiki around the world.
                    This system consists of 3 practitioner levels, and then a Master level that will train you to teach
                    and attune others to this beautiful healing system. Reiki has no belief or religious system therefore
                    be learned and practiced by everyone.
                    <br />
                    Reiki is a energy system that will positively change your life in every possible way.
