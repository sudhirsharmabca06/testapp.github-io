                    <strong>If you've never experienced hypnotherapy before, you're probably wondering what
                        your hypnotherapy session will involve. </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are so many different therapy techniques around and each therapist has his
                    or her favourites. Some hypnotherapists will prefer to use a very traditional approach
                    which focuses primarily on direct suggestions of change. Some will follow the same
                    procedure for everyone. Others tend to be much more flexible, incorporating some
                    of the newer psychotherapy techniques and tailoring each consultation to the needs
                    of their client.</p>

                I use not only clinical hypnosis, but a considerable variety of different skills.
                This allows me to adapt your treatment specifically to suit you. I have a very flexible
                and adaptable approach to therapy which enables me to treat you as a unique individual.
                Your hypnotherapy session is designed especially for you, to suit your personality
                and your particular requirements. As well as different hypnotherapy processes, your
                treatment can include other non-invasive psychotherapy and coaching techniques.
                Some or all of these methods may be used. It really depends on what your issues
                are and what we both decide would be of most benefit to you. My approach isn't at
                all about throwing a whole load of techniques at you, but about us working through
                a process that facilitates deep change.
            </p>
            <p class="quoteSction">
                I always like to involve you in your treatment. Therapy isn't something I do to
                you. but a dynamic process that we work through together.</p>
            <p class="headingfont1">
                <strong>Hypnotherapy is a very safe therapy </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hypnotherapy is a very safe therapy, as are the other methods I use. If you wish
                I will explain to you how these processes work. This means that you know what to
                expect and feel very comfortable with them. However you don't have to understand
                hypnosis and these other methods for them to work for you!

                <strong>We focus on the future rather than mainly on past events </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a firm believer in 'goal orientated therapy'. This means that you decide what
                you would like to achieve and we work together to find ways of making it possible.
                Goal orientated therapy looks towards the future rather than focusing mainly on
                past events. It helps you to make positive changes in your life. Although the bulk
                of my hypnotherapy sessions focus on the present and future, it can be extremely
                helpful to deal with any deep seated underlying issues which may be blocking your
                progress and preventing you from reaching your goal.
            </p>
            <p class="headingfont1">
                <strong>We discuss your problem</strong></p>
            <p>
                Together we discuss your problem and any emotional blocks you may have which have
                been preventing you from moving forward.</p>
            <p class="quoteSction">
                The beauty of hypnotherapy and the other methods I use is that I can teach you many
                of the techniques, including self-hypnosis, so that you can use them yourself whenever
                you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can considerably reduce the amount of treatments you require, saving you both
                valuable time and money. But more importantly, it puts YOU fully in control of YOUR
                life. I believe that therapy shouldn't be viewed as something you "have done" to
                you, but as a process that involves your input and requires your full commitment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like to be aware of what motivates you to make these changes. With a clear
                goal in mind, we can then work together to help you reach that goal.

                Although your session is tailor made to suit your individual needs, typically it
                would include proven ways to help you:</p>
            <ul class="list2">
                <li>gain more self-confidence</li>
                <li>learn how to relax</li>
                <li>cope with stress</li>
                <li>deal with negative beliefs</li>
                <li>overcome the specific issue that you seek treatment for</li>

                <strong>Did you know...</strong></p>
            <p>
                that your brain is more active when you are asleep than when you are watching television?</p>
            <p>
                Hypnosis is an education-communication process that allows a person’s conscious
                and subconscious minds to believe in the same positive message. During hypnosis
                the body and conscious mind are in a relaxed state while the subconscious mind remains
                alert and receptive to suggestion. In this state the person suspends critical judgment
                and exercises selective thinking.</p>
            <p>
                Hypnosis is a way of accessing the subconscious mind. The root cause of most physical
                and emotional problems is in the subconscious mind, created by decisions and beliefs
                formed because of a past experience that is often outside conscious memory or awareness.
                Hypnosis is a way of accessing and releasing that information and the accompanying
                emotional distress. Because hypnosis accesses the subconscious mind, it can also
                be used to improve performance. People have successfully increased sales, improved
                their sports performance, improved memory, improved health habits, and mastered
                stress and anxiety through the using hypnosis.
