                    Vastu, the ancient science of design and architecture, originated during the Vedic
                    Civilization, which many scholars assert flourished as early as 6000 years ago in
                    India and other parts of South Asia. Vastu, arguably the world’s oldest holistic
                    design system, can be considered the precursor to today’s Green Movement. Vastu
                    shows us how to create interior spaces so that they honor the rhythms that control
                    the universe and establish harmony with nature and ourselves.
