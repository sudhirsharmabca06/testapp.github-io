                                The real revolution of the last 30 years, one we are still living through, is the
                                switch from a life that is largely organized for us, once we have opted into it,
                                to a world in which we are all forced to be in charge of our own destiny. An evolution
                                in social values, pushed by breakthroughs in technology and a more competitive world,
                                all conspire to loosen the bonds between institutions and individuals. For some
                                this is exciting freedom; for others it is horrible insecurity.

                                Assertiveness skills include expressing and accepting personal rights and responsibilities,
                                making direct requests and refusals, determining limitations, reinforcing verbal
                                messages with non-verbal ones, giving and receiving praise, expressing disagreement
                                and anger, and confronting others. These skills contribute to an employee's ability
                                to succeed in attaining personal and career goals. Positive and complete interpersonal
                                communication skills must involve direct and honest expression of one's needs, feelings,
                                and opinions without threatening others.

                                to help you develop and keep a positive attitude. It is not a secret that your attitude
                                is an important key to success, both how you manage your attitude at the work place

                            <p>
                                Sales effectiveness refers to the ability of a company's sales professionals to
                                "win" at each stage of the customer's buying process, and ultimately earn the business
                                on the right terms and in the right timeframe.</p>
                            <p>
                                Improving sales effectiveness is not just a sales function issue; it's a company
                                issue, as it requires deep collaboration between sales and marketing to understand
                                what's working and not working, and continuous improvement of the knowledge, messages,
                                skills, and strategies that sales people apply as they work through sales opportunities.

                                Work-Life Balance does not mean an equal balance. Trying to schedule an equal number
                                of hours for each of your various work and personal activities is usually unrewarding
                                and unrealistic. Life is and should be more fluid than that.

                                Without balance - work suffers, home suffers and you suffer as a company. This program
                                deals with the 'whole person' and all of the issues that affect daily life - work,

                                Self-esteem and Confidence are qualities that we must develop in order to keep ourselves
                                from sadness and depression. When we fully develop Self-esteem and Confidence, we
                                feel that we can do anything and thus become successful at it.
                            </p>

                                Most people need to deal with difficult and stressful situations at work which lie
                                at the edge of their comfort zone. If we think that we are worthless, then our quality
                                of work will surely go down, making us believe that we are in fact worthless and
                                we continue to deteriorate.
