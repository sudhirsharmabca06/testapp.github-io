                                Meetings are essential in any form of human enterprise. These days, they are so
                                common that turning the resources they tie up into sustained results is a priority
                                in high-performance organizations. This is because they are potential time wasters:
                                the other persons present may not respect their own time as much as you have come
                                to respect yours, and it is therefore unlikely that they will mind wasting your
                                time. Generic actions before, during, and after can make meetings more effective.</p>

                                Everyone encounters situations where s/he has to deal with some kind of conflict.
                                Most people favor one conflict-handling style, but there is no "one-size-fits-all"
                                response to conflict. In any organizational role, be it managerial or leadership,
                                the ability to handle conflict effectively tends to influence one's effectiveness.
                                However, if we can master all possible conflict resolution styles and choose the
                                most appropriate response style depending on uniqueness of each situation, we would
                                be more effective.</p>

                                It would be easy if there was one formula that could be used in any situation, but
                                there isn't. Each decision presents its own challenges, and we all have different

                                Having an effective team around you is crucial. However, it is an area that is often
                                left to chance, which can lead to de-motivated individuals who do not feel like
                                they are part of the business and consequently do not perform. This course looks
                                at what it takes to lead an effective team and how you can get the best out of the
                                people in it by understanding the role of a leader, both personally and from the
                                point of view of the team.</p>

                                Even when personal feedback is presented to us, we're not always open to it, because
                                honest feedback isn't always flattering. Consequently, many of us have a pretty
                                low level of self-awareness. That's unfortunate, because self-awareness is an essential
                                first step toward maximizing management skills.
