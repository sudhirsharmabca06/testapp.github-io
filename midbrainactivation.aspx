                    Every parent wants the very best for their children. In pursuit of that goal, parents
                    make enormous sacrifices and go to great lengths. Nowhere is this more evident than
                    in countries with immigrant populations, such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada
                    and USA. If asked to explain what is “ the very best”, most parents would say: “We
                    want to give the very best education.

                    <strong>What is Midbrain ?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The midbrain, also called the mesencephalon, is a small region of the brain that
                    serves as a relay center for visual, auditory, and motor system information The
                    midbrain is located above the brain stem of human beings. it is responsible for
                    the perception of stimuli and the subsequent communication with the right and left
                    hemispheres to process this perceptive information. Typically, as part of the lower
                    brain centres, the mid brain is not subject to an individuals conscious awareness.
